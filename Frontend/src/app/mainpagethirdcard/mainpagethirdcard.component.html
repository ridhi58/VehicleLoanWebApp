    <b>1. Shop around for the best interest rate.</b> <br>
    Compare the rates of interest offered by various banks or financial 
    institutions before actually getting a car loan. Since there are no standard rates in the market, even a slight
    difference of a few points in the rate of interest could play a huge impact on the amount that you have to repay
    the lender. The rate of interest differs from floating to flat and varies from lender to lender. Obtain quotations
    from different dealers of the desired vehicle. Every car dealer has a tie-up with different lender and hence you 
    might receive various quotes on interest rates and other charges. This can help you in evaluating the deals available
    while helping you the best deal for your car.<br><br>

    <b>2.Accurate and complete documentation.</b> <br>
    Every lending institution follows the KYC (Know Your Customer) norms for granting loans. There is a certain set of
    documentation that needs to be completed and verified along with your credit record to fulfil the approval of a car
    loan. Prior to shopping for a car, it can help to get a pre-approved car loan car financing officer from the lender
    of choice. This guarantees faster processing of the car loan but most importantly, a pre-approved car loan also works
    as an additional leverage while negotiating with the car dealer. You will be in a better position to bargain for more
    add-ons or fewer fees while closing the deal.<br><br>
    
    <b>3.Choosing loan repayment tenure wisely.</b> <br>
    The most important part of a car loan is the loan repayment terms. Some lending executives may influence you to opt for
    a particular loan that may appear appealing to you. For instance, you might be quoted a smaller EMI amount for a seven-year
    loan period. But if you calculate the total repayment in seven years you may be in for a rude shock. Hence it is prudent to
    select the minimum loan repayment tenure that can help you to save a lot of money in the long run.<br><br>

    <b>4.Calculate your loan EMI, processing fees, and service tax and foreclosure penalties.</b> <br>
    Fortunately, these days a number of financial websites offer easy EMI calculators that can help you to plan your monthly EMI
    based on the interest rate, thus helping to decide the best interested rate and loan for your car. Also, look out for processing
    fees as various lenders charge different fees and hence a comparison of various lending options can help you make an informed
    decision. Similarly, you may also have to look into service tax, on whether it needs to be paid as a one-time lump sum fee or
    to be paid on a yearly basis. Another important factor to look into is foreclosure penalties. Most buyers are unaware of the
    foreclosure clause and since various lending institutions have different foreclosure rates it is important to choose your lending
    institution wisely. <br> <br>
    
    <b>5.Scrutinize for schemes and offers.</b> <br>
    Almost every bank or lender that offers car loans provides a number of attractive offers and deals. Armed with a sound credit profile,
    you could even bag a customized deal and in some cases you could also obtain a 0% finance scheme on your car loan amount.<br><br>
    
    It is important to be aware of the various factors that can impact your chance of securing a car loan. Seek the help of a loan official
    or an authorized car dealer for advice while at the same time researching thoroughly on the various options at hand before you.<br><br>
